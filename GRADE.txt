Nice job, especially with handling the `nil` landmark case. However, the call to `Landmark.find_by` in `show.html.erb`, 
and `Landmark.all` in `index.html.erb` should both be instead done from the `LandmarksController` (in `show` and `index` methods, respectively), not from the view! 

The `imageUrl` attribute should not be camel cased -- ruby uses underscores instead, i.e., `image_url`.

An alternative to defining all that landmark data in your model file would be to include it in a separate `yml`
file, and import it into `landmark.rb`.
